Data visualisation using data from Ireland's Property Price Register

The dataset in use here is not dynamically retrieved from the PPR website, it is taken from a static grab of all house sale data in the PPR as of Nov, 15 2013. The primary motivation here is to play around with data visualisation rather than to provide yet another PPR search tool.
