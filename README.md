> Data visualisation using data from Ireland's Residential Property Price Register

A quick hack using data from Ireland's [Residential Property Price Register](https://www.propertypriceregister.ie/website/npsra/pprweb.nsf/page/ppr-home-en) to play around with [D3](http://d3js.org), [dc.js](http://nickqizhu.github.io/dc.js/) and [crossfilter](http://square.github.io/crossfilter/) data visualisation. The dataset in use here is not dynamically retrieved from the PPR website, it is taken from a static grab of house sale data from the PPR. The primary motivation here is to play around with data visualisation rather than to provide yet another PPR search tool.

This tool uses a static dump of the PPR data, so by the time you (or anyone) looks at it the data will likely be somewhat out of date. That said, I periodically grab a fresh copy of the data so you might be in luck. However, the primary purpose of this tool is to play around with  in-browser data visualisation tools so the staleness (or otherwise) of the data is secondary. Regardless of how recently the PPR dump was taken there will be several years of data available for visualisation.
